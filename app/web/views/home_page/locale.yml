    about_content: Welcome to Shards of Tokyo - the personalised Japanese items delivery! My name is Kuba and, with lots of luck and even more hard work, I was able to move to Japan. As someone who was interested in Japan for many years myself I know how you feel; reading, watching, dreaming, enjoying every single piece of Japanese culture you were able to get. Japan has so much to offer and you definitely should come here and see all those things on your own eyes but till than I can send you all kind of items from Japan. Letâ€™s be friends!
