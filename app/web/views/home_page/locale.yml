    custom_plan_title: Custom Items Plan
    custom_plan_content: If there is something you really wish to get, but its available only in Japan you still can have it! Maybe you want an original manga book from your favourite series? Or an retro j-rpg gameboy game from Akihabara? Cosplay accessory? Good fortune charm from a shrine? Or maybe just something you saw on JP Amazon - I can still try to buy it for you!
    custom_plan_content2: "Custom Plan price is really hard to estimate. I try to find the item first, and see the price. Depending on item size and shipping method, costs of shipment can really vary. To be able to maintain the website I’ll add 10% to the base item price.\nThe process is manual, no robots, no algorithms, you can always ask me any questions or exchange ideas."
