    about_content: Welcome to Shards of Tokyo - the personalised Japanese items delivery! My name is Kuba and, with lots of luck and even more hard work, I was able to move to Japan. As someone who was interested in Japan for many years myself I know how you feel; reading, watching, dreaming, enjoying every single piece of Japanese culture you were able to get. Japan has so much to offer and you definitely should come here and see all those things on your own eyes but till than I can send you all kind of items from Japan. Letâ€™s be friends!

    section1_content: Let say you always wanted to try Japanese candies, or read authentic manga of your favourite series, or there is something you saw on Japanese amazon! Just create an account, and let me now the details. I will try to find it and buy it for you.
    section2_content: I set up secure payment system (via Stripe - a leading internet payment gateway) to make purchasing secure and hassle-free. Depending on an item, its size and weight, destination country and the acceptable shipment duration the price may vary.
    section3_content: After consulting with you and basically setting everythings up I will send the package/letter to a given address. I know very good the feeling of receiving a gift from overseas! I really love sending things to my friends, true happiness is in giving - thats why whole this website exists in a first place!
