Just for you!"

    candies_plan_content: "Candies Plan is actually the reason I built this website. I love Japanese snacks and I love sending them to my friends and family.\nIf you want also to get a penpal-style letter, just write something about youself when creating an account. I will try to cover topics we both like and enjoy.\n3-4 Japanese snacks for just $9 (tax and shipping included)!"

    custom_plan_title: Custom Items - price + $9
    custom_plan_content: "If there is something you really wish to get, but it is available only in Japan you still can have it! Maybe you want an original manga book from your favourite series? Or a retro j-rpg gameboy game from Akihabara? Cosplay accessory? A good fortune charm from a shrine? Or maybe just something you saw on JP Amazon - I can still try to buy it for you!\n\n\nCustom Items pricing is really hard to estimate. I will try to find the item first, and see the price. Depending on item size and shipping method, costs of shipment may really vary. To be able to maintain the website Iâ€™ll add $9 total costs (base item price + shipment).\nThe process is manual, no robots, no algorithms, you can always ask me any questions at any given time."
